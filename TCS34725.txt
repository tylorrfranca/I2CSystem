    Description
          The TCS3472 device provides a digital return of red, green, blue (RGB), and clear light sensing values. An IR
          blocking filter, integrated on-chip and localized to the color sensing photodiodes, minimizes the IR spectral
          component of the incoming light and allows color measurements to be made accurately. The high sensitivity,
          wide dynamic range, and IR blocking filter make the TCS3472 an ideal color sensor solution for use under
          varying lighting conditions and through attenuating materials.
          The TCS3472 color sensor has a wide range of applications including RGB LED backlight control, solid-state
          lighting, health/fitness products, industrial process controls and medical diagnostic equipment. In addition, the
          IR blocking filter enables the TCS3472 to perform ambient light sensing (ALS). Ambient light sensing is widely
          used in display-based products such as cell phones, notebooks, and TVs to sense the lighting environment and
          enable automatic display brightness for optimal viewing and power savings. The TCS3472, itself, can enter a
          lower-power wait state between light sensing measurements to further reduce the average power consumption.

Detailed Description
      The TCS3472 light-to-digital converter contains a 3 × 4 photodiode array, four analog-to-digital converters
      (ADC) that integrate the photodiode current, data registers, a state machine, and an I2C interface. The 3 × 4
      photodiode array is composed of red-filtered, green-filtered, blue-filtered, and clear (unfiltered) photodiodes.
      In addition, the photodiodes are coated with an IR-blocking filter. The four integrating ADCs simultaneously
      convert the amplified photodiode currents to a 16-bit digital value. Upon completion of a conversion cycle, the
      results are transferred to the data registers, which are double-buffered to ensure the integrity of the data. All
      of the internal timing, as well as the low-power wait state, is controlled by the state machine.
      Communication of the TCS3472 data is accomplished over a fast, up to 400 kHz, two-wire I2C serial bus. The
      industry standard I2C bus facilitates easy, direct connection to microcontrollers and embedded processors.
      In addition to the I2C bus, the TCS3472 provides a separate interrupt signal output. When interrupts are
      enabled, and user-defined thresholds are exceeded, the active-low interrupt is asserted and remains asserted
      until it is cleared by the controller. This interrupt feature simplifies and improves the efficiency of the system
      software by eliminating the need to poll the TCS3472. The user can define the upper and lower interrupt
      thresholds and apply an interrupt persistence filter. The interrupt persistence filter allows the user to define the
      number of consecutive out-of-threshold events necessary before generating an interrupt. The interrupt output
      is open-drain, so it can be wire-ORed with other devices.

                                       PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION

System States
    An internal state machine provides system control of the RGBC and power management features of the device.
    At power up, an internal power-on-reset initializes the device and puts it in a low-power Sleep state.
    When a start condition is detected on the I2C bus, the device transitions to the Idle state where it checks the
    Enable Register (0x00) PON bit. If PON is disabled, the device will return to the Sleep state to save power.
    Otherwise, the device will remain in the Idle state until the RGBC function is enabled (AEN). Once enabled, the
    device will execute the Wait and RGBC states in sequence as indicated in Figure 5. Upon completion and return
    to Idle, the device will automatically begin a new Wait-RGBC cycle as long as PON and AEN remain enabled.

RGBC Operation
      The RGBC engine contains RGBC gain control (AGAIN) and four integrating analog-to-digital converters (ADC)
      for the RGBC photodiodes. The RGBC integration time (ATIME) impacts both the resolution and the sensitivity
      of the RGBC reading. Integration of all four channels occurs simultaneously and upon completion of the
      conversion cycle, the results are transferred to the color data registers. This data is also referred to as channel
      count.
      The transfers are double-buffered to ensure that invalid data is not read during the transfer. After the
      transfer, the device automatically moves to the next state in accordance with the configured state machine.

      NOTE: In this document, the nomenclature uses the bit field name in italics followed by the register address
      and bit number to allow the user to easily identify the register and bit that controls the function. For example,
      the power on (PON) is in register 0x00, bit 0. This is represented as PON (r0x00:b0).
      The registers for programming the integration and wait times are a 2’s compliment values. The actual time can
      be calculated as follows:
                             ATIME = 256 − Integration Time / 2.4 ms
      Inversely, the time can be calculated from the register value as follows:
                            Integration Time = 2.4 ms × (256 − ATIME)
      For example, if a 100-ms integration time is needed, the device needs to be programmed to:
                            256 − (100 / 2.4) = 256 − 42 = 214 = 0xD6
      Conversely, the programmed value of 0xC0 would correspond to:
                           (256 − 0xC0) × 2.4 = 64 × 2.4 = 154 ms.

Interrupts
    The interrupt feature simplifies and improves system efficiency by eliminating the need to poll the sensor for
    light intensity values outside of a user-defined range. While the interrupt function is always enabled and its
    status is available in the status register (0x13), the output of the interrupt state can be enabled using the RGBC
    interrupt enable (AIEN) field in the enable register (0x00).
    Two 16-bit interrupt threshold registers allow the user to set limits below and above a desired light level. An
    interrupt can be generated when the Clear data (CDATA) is less than the Clear interrupt low threshold (AILTx)
    or is greater than the Clear interrupt high threshold (AIHTx).
    It is important to note that the thresholds are evaluated in sequence, first the low threshold, then the high
    threshold. As a result, if the low threshold is set above the high threshold, the high threshold is ignored and only
    the low threshold is evaluated.
    To further control when an interrupt occurs, the device provides a persistence filter. The persistence filter allows
    the user to specify the number of consecutive out-of-range Clear occurrences before an interrupt is generated.
    The persistence filter register (0x0C) allows the user to set the Clear persistence filter (APERS) value. See the
    persistence filter register for details on the persistence filter value. Once the persistence filter generates an
    interrupt, it will continue until a special function interrupt clear command is received (see command register).

System Timing
      The system state machine shown in Figure 5 provides an overview of the states and state transitions that
      provide system control of the device. This section highlights the programmable features, which affect the state
      machine cycle time, and provides details to determine system level timing.
      When the power management feature is enabled (WEN), the state machine will transition to the Wait state. The
      wait time is determined by WLONG, which extends normal operation by 12× when asserted, and WTIME. The
      formula to determine the wait time is given in the box associated with the Wait state in Figure 9.
      When the RGBC feature is enabled (AEN), the state machine will transition through the RGBC Init and RGBC
      ADC states. The RGBC Init state takes 2.4 ms, while the RGBC ADC time is dependent on the integration time
      (ATIME). The formula to determine RGBC ADC time is given in the associated box in Figure 9. If an interrupt
      is generated as a result of the RGBC cycle, it will be asserted at the end of the RGBC ADC.

Power Management
       Power consumption can be managed with the Wait state, because the Wait state typically consumes only 65 μA
       of IDD current. An example of the power management feature is given below. With the assumptions provided
       in the example, average IDD is estimated to be 152 μA.

       Average IDD Current = ((43.2 × 0.065) + (43.2 × 0.235) + (2.40 × 0.235)) / 89  152 μA


       Keeping with the same programmed values as the example, Table 2 shows how the average IDD current is

I2C Protocol
      Interface and control are accomplished through an I2C serial compatible interface (standard or fast mode) to
      a set of registers that provide access to device control functions and output data. The devices support the 7-bit
      I2C addressing protocol.
      The I2C standard provides for three types of bus transaction: read, write, and a combined protocol (Figure 10).
      During a write operation, the first byte written is a command byte followed by data. In a combined protocol, the
      first byte written is the command byte followed by reading a series of bytes. If a read command is issued, the
      register address from the previous command will be used for data access. Likewise, if the MSB of the command
      is not set, the device will write a series of bytes at the address stored in the last valid command with a register
      address. The command byte contains either control information or a 5-bit register address. The control
      commands can also be used to clear interrupts.
      The I2C bus protocol was developed by Philips (now NXP). For a complete description of the I2C protocol, please
      review the NXP I2C design specification at http://www.i2c−bus.org/references/.

Register Set
    The TCS3472 is controlled and monitored by data registers and a command register accessed through the
    serial interface. These registers provide for a variety of control functions and can be read to determine results
    of the ADC conversions. The register set is summarized in Table 3.

    The mechanics of accessing a specific register depends on the specific protocol used. See the section on I2C
    protocols on the previous pages. In general, the COMMAND register is written first to specify the specific
    control-status-data register for subsequent read/write operations.

RGBC Interrupt Threshold Registers (0x04 − 0x07)
    The RGBC interrupt threshold registers provides the values to be used as the high and low trigger points for
    the comparison function for interrupt generation. If the value generated by the clear channel crosses below the
    lower threshold specified, or above the higher threshold, an interrupt is asserted on the interrupt pin.

Persistence Register (0x0C)
    The persistence register controls the filtering interrupt capabilities of the device. Configurable filtering is
    provided to allow interrupts to be generated after each integration cycle or if the integration has produced a result
    that is outside of the values specified by the threshold register for some specified amount of time.

RGBC Channel Data Registers (0x14 − 0x1B)
    Clear, red, green, and blue data is stored as 16-bit values. To ensure the data is read correctly, a two-byte read
    I2C transaction should be used with a read word protocol bit set in the command register. With this operation,
    when the lower byte register is read, the upper eight bits are stored into a shadow register, which is read by a
    subsequent read to the upper byte. The upper register will read the correct value even if additional ADC
    integration cycles end between the reading of the lower and upper registers.

                                                            SOLDERING INFORMATION

    The FN package has been tested and has demonstrated an ability to be reflow soldered to a PCB
    substrate. The process, equipment, and materials used in these test are detailed below.
    The solder reflow profile describes the expected maximum heat exposure of components during the solder
    reflow process of product on a PCB. Temperature is measured on top of component. The components should
    be limited to a maximum of three passes through this solder reflow profile.

                                           STORAGE INFORMATION

Moisture Sensitivity
      Optical characteristics of the device can be adversely affected during the soldering process by the release and
      vaporization of moisture that has been previously absorbed into the package. To ensure the package contains
      the smallest amount of absorbed moisture possible, each device is dry-baked prior to being packed for shipping.
      Devices are packed in a sealed aluminized envelope called a moisture barrier bag with silica gel to protect them
      from ambient moisture during shipping, handling, and storage before use.
      The Moisture Barrier Bags should be stored under the following conditions:
              Temperature Range     < 40°C
              Relative Humidity     < 90%
              Total Time            No longer than 12 months from the date code on the aluminized envelope if
                                     unopened.

      Rebaking of the reel will be required if the devices have been stored unopened for more than 12 months and
      the Humidity Indicator Card shows the parts to be out of the allowable moisture region.
      Opened reels should be used within 168 hours if exposed to the following conditions:
              Temperature Range     < 30°C
              Relative Humidity     < 60%

      If rebaking is required, it should be done at 50°C for 12 hours.
      The FN package has been assigned a moisture sensitivity level of MSL 3.
